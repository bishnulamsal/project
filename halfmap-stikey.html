        Sticky elements (position: sticky;) are very similar to fixed elements ( position: fixed;) in that they both maintain their position on the screen, even as the user scrolls up or down the page. The difference? A sticky element remains confined to the parent container it is in. Compare sticky example above with this one that uses the same concept using a fixed element instead:Sticky elements (position: sticky;) are very similar to fixed elements ( position: fixed;) in that they both maintain their position on the screen, even as the user scrolls up or down the page.
